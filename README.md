A website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The focus was exploring the logic required to create a tic-tac-toe game.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I'd like to make the result() DRY. I would also spend more time on the CSS to make the game more aesthetically pleasing. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned about using querySelector for elements whose id begins with a number requires an escape or just use getElementById
